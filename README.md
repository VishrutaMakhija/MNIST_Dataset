MNIST Dataset\
Performed analysis on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology Database) is a massive handwritten number database that is generally used for image analysis. It is popularly used in machine learning. The goal is to train a model that detects the handwritten digits correctly.
